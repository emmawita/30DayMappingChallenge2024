  Description:
    Abstract: This data set contains a digital terrain model of the State of Rhode Island presented in ESRI terrain format, saved within an ESRI 9.3 file geodatabase.  The terrain was derived from individual point locations and associated elevation values originally developed for the orthographic retification of aerial photography taken in 1997 of Rhode Island.
    Purpose: These data may be used to support the generation of surface models and contours, or used to support the orthorectification of aerial photography.  Please note that these data were intended solely for the orthorectify aerial photographs collected at a map scale of 1:5000, and these data are not considered adequate by RIGIS for purposes other than general planning.

    Due to the scale, accuracy of the source data information contained should be used with caution.  These data may be used to support the generation of surface models and contours, or used to support the orthorectification of aerial photography.  Please note that these data were intended solely for the orthorectify aerial photographs collected at a map scale of 1:5000, and these data are not considered adequate by RIGIS for purposes other than general planning.  These data are estimated to be suitable for 3-meter accuracy for determination of general elevations.
    Potential users are encouraged to evaluate the individual feature classes that were used to build this terrain, and judge for themselves as to whether or not these data suit their needs.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        1) A new feature dataset, terrain_5KDTM, was created in an existing file geodatabase using ESRI ArcGIS 9.3 Desktop.
        2) The boundary, mass points, hard breaklines, and soft breaklines feature classes were imported into the new feature dataset.

        3) A new terrain feature class was using the following settings:
        A) Selected boundary, mass points, hard breaklines, and soft breaklines as feature classes that would participate in the terrain.
        B) Used an approximate point spacing of 40 feet (Vinhaterio 2008).
        C) Specified mass points feature class as SFType = mass points; hard breaklines as SFType = hard line; soft breaklines as SFType = soft line; boundary as SFType = soft clip.
        4) Built the terrain using the default pyramid levels as presented by the software.
        PLEASE NOTE: FGDC compliant metadata for the feature classes used to build the terrain are present within the file geodatabase itself.  The metadata are viewable by using ESRI ArcCatalog to first highlight the feature class of interest within the file geodatabase, then choosing the Metadata tab.
        PLEASE ALSO NOTE: Users of this terrain feature class may wish to rebuild the terrain using their own breaklines and/or average point spacing information.  This is possible by using the ESRI ArcGIS 9.3 3D Analyst Terrain tools.
